=== Get access token

Via Browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=client&scope=read
```

The authorization server tries to call `http://127.0.0.1:9090/home?code=4hbLmN`. Then:
```
POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50OnNlY3JldA==
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=authorization_code&code=4hbLmN
```

=== Example 1

```
git checkout ch15-ex1
```

Using a JWT signed with a symmetric key. The authorization and resource server are using
the same signing key. With that key the authorization server will sign the JWT when it is
created and the resource server will use that key, to check the validity of the JWT.
